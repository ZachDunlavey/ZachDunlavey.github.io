### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    This lab is one of my favorites because it revolved around my two favorite things, math and pizza. Though this was a while ago, I remember specifically enjoying this lab because of the equation that we had to figure out how to code. I learned how to incorporate an equation into the code and reprint input arguments.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 is one of my favorite labs because it is relatively simple but very useful. I enjoyed learning to code this because it can be applied in a countless number of ways and made me reminisce about the times I would play Madlib games with my friends.I learned how to write a program that fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order.

* Lab 10

    I enjoyed coding lab 10 Part 1 because I found the topic of writing a code to determine if a number is a prime number or not very interesting. I found it fascinating to realize that the way we can check if a number is prime as a human is very different from how a computer can be coded to check. I learned how to code this as well as how to reverse a string.
